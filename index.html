        Today, I decided it's time to start making my own projects. Two weeks ago I was looking for another skill too have. So many videos I've watched while slowly creeping through The Odin Project. This new information is not sticking! 
        There needs to be more hands on. I need to <strong>start building things!</strong> I need some <strong>coding time.</strong> Not <em>reading time.</em> I think this will help me learn more efficiently. </p>
    <h3>What To Do</h3>
    <p> 
        Lets use an <strong>Unordered List</strong> here.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take a week to build this web page and utilize what ive learned.</li>
            <li>Use any and all resorces at my disposal to develope this page.</li>
            <li>Use as many different lessons i can that i have picked up so far</li>
            <li>Try and explain everything I do for reference</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Next lets try out an <strong>Ordered List</strong> now.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get organized</li>
            <li>program every day! Even if its fine tuning old content.</li>
            <li>Take notes on paper while i code this mother out.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the benefits of knowing more than I knew a week ago.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Wow! Well would you look at that! She's lookin pretty nice so far. Lets keep going! Lets get into some things called <strong>Anchor Elements.</strong> Theres two kinds of links i've learned also. Absolute and relative. I really need to take a typing class!
        </p>
        <h2>Absolute link</h2>
        <p>words about absolute links go here</p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>
        <h2>Relative link</h2>
        <p>
            The relative link is another page on my own site.
        </p>
           <a href="pages/about.html">A page on my site</a>
        <p>
            Use the absolute link to link a page thats not on your site. Use the relative to link to another page in your pages folder where the web page is.
        </p>
